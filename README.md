# Membrane Fouling Models for Cross-Flow Mode


The Jupyter Notebook takes in .csv files with two columns (Time and Flux) and returns the estimated parameters of the models and an Excel Spreadsheet with the corresponding data predicted by the implemented models.

The models used in the python script are presented presented in the paper [Modelling of permeability loss in membrane filtration: Re-examination of fundamental fouling equations and their link to critical flux](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916411003596)  as equation s 6, 8, 9, and 10.
